# Python Contribution Scripts
## Description
This is simply a holding spot for a couple Python scripts
that I find useful for testing and scripting.

## What Is It?
These are seconod-generation versions of scripts I used to use
at work.  I hope to use them in the future for testing purposes.

## What Will It Do?
No documentation on these, I'm afraid.  Please check the USAGE
statements.

## How Do I install It?
No install necessary.  However, these scripts are only compatible
with Python v2.7.x.  Hopefully I'll get around to upgrading them
someday.

## Who Is Working On It?
Just me at the moment.
